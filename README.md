# Sol Client -- GlassMC Port

See the main [repo](https://github.com/Sol-Client/Client) for the actually updated version (that isn't using glass).

From what I can see, everything should work as intended like the regular Sol Client (with the exception of replay mod, which I have not attempted to get that working in glassmc).

## Why?
I thought it would be a good idea to have some fun working with Sol Client while also finding bugs for glassmc (there were many). I'm not sure what I want to do with this repository in the future (except maybe eventually getting the system good enought for mcblueparrot to use it for actual Sol Client.
